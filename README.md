## Day 1
- Part 1: Straightforward looping over strings.
- Part 2: Made a mess of this! Initially I just replaced "one" with "1" and so on, but that relies on the order, so "twone" gives "tw1" when it should notice that there is a "two" first. Then I got stuck because I read the instruction as meaning "twone" should translate to "2ne", but actually it should be "21" as it shares the "o". I thought this was a bit hard for day 1 :D
